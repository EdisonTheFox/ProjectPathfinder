## What is Project Pathfinder?
Project Pathfinder is a pet project that will allow a user to easily have both 1st and 2nd Editions of the core Pathfinder RPG rulebooks at their fingertips. It's created using Xamarin to allow full cross platform mobile compatibility.

## Are you going to be adding the rest of the books?
Yes! But not immediately. I'll be focussing on the core rules for 1st and 2nd edition firstly as these are the most important!
